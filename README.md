by issuing the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* Run the file `main.py` to train new models.
* Run the file `evaluate.py` to run evaluations on the test dataset. Also run this
file if you want to recreate the numbers shown in the paper.
* To create new figures or to recreate the figures shown in the paper run the 
Jupyter notebook `make_visualizations.ipynb`.

To download the data, both raw and processed, and the trained models follow the link below.

Make sure there are no whitespaces in the password. Unzip and place both of the folders on
the same level as the folder `src`.
